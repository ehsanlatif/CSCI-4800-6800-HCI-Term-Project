Solution:
  Create a program/application that allows for live-time coding. The app will have different roles, administrator and member. Administrators have overseeing powers and
will be able to modify member's codes if they see neccessary. This way, instructors can give out practice problems and observe what each student needs while coding. The
application/program will have one-on-one question system, where students ask the instructor a question privately. Sometimes students feel embarrassed to ask questions in front of the whole class. Thus, this system will also help teaching process and making sure students understand what they are doing. The instructor will also be able to
see each student's screens through the program, almost like other communication programs like Zoom. However, the instructors will see the student's screen and will be able to interact with it. For peer-to-peer case, all of the peers will have the administrator role. They will be able to edit, review, and leave feedback to other peer's codes. All of this will be done live-time, and users will be able to use this program efficiently with all of the tools provided. Coding process will definitely be easier than before with the implementation of this tool.
