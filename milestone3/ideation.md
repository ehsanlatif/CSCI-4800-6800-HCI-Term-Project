## Ideation and Preliminary Designs
In this section we will provide ideation for our relavent user stories.

### Relavent User Stories
1. As a teacher, I want to be able to create a team and collaborate with my classmates in a group.
2. As a teacher, I want to be able to put comments for students individually or for the whole class.
3. As a teacher, I want to be able to see all of the student's screens so I can monitor their progress and see if part of the assignment needs clarification.
4. As a student, I want to ask the teacher questions privately so I can resolve my issues comfortably.
5. As a student, I want to see my instructor's comments in real-time on my code so that I can improvise my code accordingly.
6. As a programmer working for a company, I want to be able to share my work with my coworkers so that we can work on project together at the same time, offering feedback and comments.
