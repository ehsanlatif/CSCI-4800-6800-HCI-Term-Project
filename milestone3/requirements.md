## User Experience Requirements

This section contains decomposition of user stories based allowed tasks/activities in our system.

### User Categories
1. Programmer
2. Teacher
3. Student

### Task Based User Stories

#### Task 1. Creation of collaborative teams
##### Relavent User Story: 
1. As a teacher, I want to be able to create a team and collaborate with my classmates in a group.
> **Reason for relavence:** To assign a project to each group of students and ask them to do that as a team. Also, I want to form groups of students and consider a leader for each team. The leader is more talented in that course/topic  and is responsible for answering his/her teammates' questions and helping them.
##### Irrelavent User Stories:
2. As a teacher, I want to create programming classes for students so that students can access them for learning. 
3. As a teacher, I want to create and give out practice problems so that students learn about a specific topic.

#### Task 2. Providance of Suggestion/Comments for individual user or a team
##### Relavent User Story: 
1. As a teacher, I want to be able to put comments for students individually or for the whole class.
> **Reason fo relavence:** To be able to give them hint individually if they need help or if most of them are making the same mistake be able to hint all of them.
##### Irrelavent User Stories: 
2. As a teacher I want to able to insert grades.
3. As a teacher I want t obe able to hide previous or future cources from students. 

#### Task 3. Live surveillance through shared screen
##### Relavent User Story: 
1. As a teacher, I want to be able to see all of the student's screens so I can monitor their progress and see if part of the assignment needs clarification.
> **Reason fo relavence:** Live visualization of students preformance enhance productivity.
##### Irrelavent User Stories:
2. As a teacher I want to ba able to give student the permission to participate in the course.
3. As a user(all types of users), I want to see my coding history so that I can quickly revise my code.

#### Task 4. View comments and following instructions
##### Relavent User Story: 
1. As a student, I want to ask the teacher questions privately so I can resolve my issues comfortably.
> **Reason fo relavence:** It helps teacher-student interaction and bolsters the learning capability of students as some students are shy to ask during class.
##### Irrelavent User Stories:
2. As a student, I want to see my instructor's written code so that I will compare mine for validation.
3. As a user, I want to register with the system so that I can access all features of the system.
4. As a student, I want to enroll in a course so that I will learn about it.

#### Task 5. Private question answering
##### Relavent User Story: 
1. As a student, I want to see my instructor's comments in real-time on my code so that I can improvise my code accordingly.
> **Reason fo relavence:** To have real-time feedback will help students to reduce the burden of after-class questioning and allow students to be on the track during the session.
##### Irrelavent User Stories:
2. As a student I want to search for specific teacher and course so that I will get to my desired one.
3. As a student, I want to get unenrolled from the course after learning so that I will have only relevant courses in my  portal.
4. As a student, I want to receive a course completion certificate so that I will use it later.

#### Task 6. Code Sharing
##### Relavent User Story: 
1. As a programmer working for a company, I want to be able to share my work with my coworkers so that we can work on project together at the same time, offering feedback and comments.
> **Reason fo relavence:** Programmers often have to work on a project with other programmers to develop a working program. Currently, there is not a great way for programmers to work on the project together at the same time. Therefore, our solution will offer a quick and efficient way for programmers to work on their projects and produce an output without being hindered by the lack of live coding.
##### Irrelavent User Stories:
2. As a pogrammer, I want to Supervise and intern idea so that I can manage team internally
