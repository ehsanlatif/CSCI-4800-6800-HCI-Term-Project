## High Fidelity Prototype
In this section we will provide whole view of prototype of our working system.
### User Stories
We will provide functioning prototype of our system with the help of explanatory demonstration videos for following user stories.

1. As a teacher, I want to be able to create a team and collaborate with my classmates in a group.
2. As a teacher, I want to be able to put comments for students individually or for the whole class.
3. As a teacher, I want to be able to see all of the student's screens so I can monitor their progress and see if part of the assignment needs clarification.
4. As a programmer working for a company, I want to be able to share my work with my coworkers so that we can work on project together at the same time, offering feedback and comments.
5. As a student, I want to see my instructor's comments in real-time on my code so that I can improvise my code accordingly.
6. As a student, I want to ask the teacher questions privately so I can resolve my issues comfortably.

### Prorotypes
#### UserStory 1
**Statement** As a teacher, I want to be able to create a team and collaborate with my classmates in a group.

**Description** Teacher should be able to select a student among all students to send him a comment or send a comment to all of the students to select all or every one.

#### UserStory 2
**Statement** As a teacher, I want to be able to put comments for students individually or for the whole class.

**Description** In order to create group projects and ask students to do a project as a team the teacher needs to create breakout groups.

#### UserStory 3
**Statement** As a teacher, I want to be able to see all of the student's screens so I can monitor their progress and see if part of the assignment needs clarification.

**Description** Similar to Zoom’s function when sharing cameras in a big class setting, all of the student’s screens will be shared in the main screen. Then, the teacher can click on each student’s screen to leave feedback to the students.

#### UserStory 4
**Statement** As a programmer working for a company, I want to be able to share my work with my coworkers so that we can work on project together at the same time, offering feedback and comments.

**Description** Coworkers should be able to work on a project together at the same time and be able to leave feedback on others’ works using the comment function.

#### UserStory 5
**Statement:** As a student, I want to see my instructor's comments in real-time on my code so that I can improvise my code accordingly.

**Description** During programming, students shall see teachers comments and follow instructions, prototype has comment section which is visible to each student where all class members including teacher can discuss about specific prorgamming problem. System allows them to reference code lines for discussion in the comment section.

#### UserStory 6
**Statement** As a student, I want to ask the teacher questions privately so I can resolve my issues comfortably.

**Description** On the coding portal, if the student has to ask questions, they shall navigate to the QnA portal and ask questions, in which he or they can also refer to the relevant code segment. Suppose a student requires more attention or hesitated about something to ask in a group. In that case, he shall use the QnA portal to ask privet questions. the system allows users to ask questions synchronously during the course sessions.
